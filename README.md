About Me

I’m an AI-augmented developer focused on using Generative AI to build and ship practical software more efficiently.

My core work revolves around Python, Prompt Engineering, and the Google Gemini API, where I design AI-driven workflows for rapid prototyping, code generation, and application logic. I integrate AI directly into the development lifecycle instead of treating it as an add-on, enabling faster iteration and reduced build time.

To deliver usable products, I work with modern web technologies as delivery layers for AI-powered functionality, rather than as a frontend specialization.

I’m currently pursuing a B.Tech in Information Technology and actively building AI-driven projects that prioritize real-world usability, speed, and reliability.
