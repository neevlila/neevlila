## About

I’m an AI-augmented developer who integrates Generative AI directly into the software development process to build and ship usable products faster.

My core work centers around Python, Prompt Engineering, and the Google Gemini API. I use AI for rapid prototyping, code generation, and workflow automation, resulting in faster iteration and reduced development time on recent projects.

To deliver complete applications, I work with modern web technologies as supporting layers for AI-powered functionality, rather than as a frontend specialization.
